data Manipulation :- 
chnaging,orgnizing  or prepering data to make it useful and easiesr to understand.

goal : to  clean ,tranform and structre raw data  for better usablity


Exa:-
  Organizing a Grocery list: sorting random items   into cartegory  like "fruits" or "daliry"

  Fizing errors:- 



Data analysis:-
 exttarcing paatern ,tread and insighs from the data to solve 

 goal : to answer question or identify treads using datak



NumPy = math, matrices, vectors, fast calculations
Pandas = handling and cleaning datasets
Both are essential. You cannot do ML without them.



Load data → Pandas
Clean & preprocess → Pandas
Convert to arrays → NumPy
Train model → NumPy inside ML libraries
Save/Analyze results → Pandas + NumPy


| Feature  | NumPy                        | Pandas                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Best For | Math, arrays, matrices       | Tables, datasets                    |
| Handles  | Numbers only                 | All types (strings, dates, numbers) |
| Speed    | Faster                       | Slower than NumPy                   |
| Used In  | ML training, neural networks | Data cleaning, CSV/Excel            |
| Shape    | 1D & 2D arrays               | DataFrame (rows & columns)          |




diffrenct between Manipulation and analysis

Manipulation  :-
   maninly clean  Organizing and fix the errors  from data

analysis:

   exttarcing ,find paaterns and solve problems from data
